# FiLM: Visual and Mathematical Reasoning with a General Conditioning Layer

## Faiz Ganz, Tashrif Chowdhury, David Glazer

This code replicates the implementation of a Feature-wise Linear Modulation approach to Visual Reasoning (original code [here](https://github.com/ethanjperez/film)), reproducing results from the AAAI 2018 paper "FiLM: Visual Reasoning with a General Conditioning Layer", and extends its application to a newly released expansion of the CLEVR Dataset called CLEVR-Math.
