# FiLM: Visual and Mathematical Reasoning with a General Conditioning Layer

## Faiz Ganz, Tashrif Chowdhury, David Glazer

This code replicates the implementation of a Feature-wise Linear Modulation approach to Visual Reasoning, reproducing results from the AAAI 2018 paper "FiLM: Visual Reasoning with a General Conditioning Layer" (citation [here](https://github.com/ethanjperez/film#film)), and extends its application to a newly released expansion of the CLEVR Dataset called CLEVR-Math. Please see the [retrospective paper](https://ml-retrospectives.github.io/neurips2019/accepted_retrospectives/2019/film/) (citation [here](https://github.com/ethanjperez/film#retrospective-for-film)) for an honest reflection on FiLM after the work that followed, including when to (and not to) use FiLM and tips-and-tricks for effectively training a network with FiLM layers.
